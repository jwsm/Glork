To use this library in MaxMSP:
* Clone the repository to a local directory on your machine
* Add that directory as a search path in MaxMSP
* Restart MaxMSP
* Use the libraries! (for instance:)
	* Create a new object in your Max patch (press "n")
	* Enter the name of a GLORK object, i.e. GL_WiiMotion
	* Press shift-cmd-H to get help on the object
	Note: Some interface patches are optimized to be used within bpatchers
